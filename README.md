## About

This is a simple proof of concept. It can be viewed and tested at [rgi.vercel.app](https://rgi.vercel.app).

Pressing the button in the center will randomly generate an image and place it on the user's cursor in a movable state.
Left clicking will cause the image to rest on the location clicked and clicking it once more will make it moveable.

## Getting Started

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
